# ThGEM
Two iterations of ThGEM that are prototyped  
They were created with a custom component consistant of 2 parts.  
    

### Dimensions of the Board 
-Outer Ring (80 mm in Diamater)  
-Copper Circle (60 mm in Diamater)

### GEM-Hole Dimensions  
-Edge Cut (0.4 mm in Diameter)  
-No Fill Zone (0.42 mm in Diameter) #Only included in the Clearance Version
